Fairy Battle Cards
================

Spell and Action Cards for fairy battles!

I created these cards for my daughters to do some more fun things with their Schleich fantasy figures (see http://www.schleich-s.com/toys/iloris_elves/) and various bad guys assembled from random toys. 

Think of it as being a bit like Warhammer Junior Edition :)

We usually play with each player picking 5 random cards from the pile, swapping out any they can't use. Or choose 10 and put back 5 you don't want.
